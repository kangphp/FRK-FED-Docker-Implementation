# FRK-FED Docker Implementation

**FRK-FED-Docker-Implementation** is a modular, Docker-based deployment for the FRK-FED microservices ecosystem. This repository provides ready-to-use Docker Compose configurations and service definitions to orchestrate authentication, frontend, backend, and API gateway components. Designed for scalability and developer productivity, it enables rapid setup and easy management of distributed services in a containerized environment.

## Introduction

This project aims to simplify the deployment and development of the FRK-FED microservices stack using Docker and Docker Compose. By containerizing each service, developers can build, test, and scale components independently while maintaining a unified development workflow.

## Features

- Modular microservices deployment
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Isolated environments for each service
- Easy scalability and management
- Rapid local development and testing

## Architecture

The system consists of several microservices, each running in its own container:

- **Frontend**: User interface, typically a web application
- **Backend**: Core business logic and API
- **Authentication**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services

All services communicate over a Docker network, ensuring seamless integration and scalability.

## Requirements

- Docker (v20+ recommended)
- Docker Compose (v2+ recommended)
- (Optional) Node.js, if you want to run backend/frontend locally

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kangphp/FRK-FED-Docker-Implementation.git
    cd FRK-FED-Docker-Implementation
    ```

2. **Build and start all services:**
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. **Access the application:**
    - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - Backend/API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
    - Authentication: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
    - API Gateway: [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

> **Note:** Ports may vary based on your `docker-compose.yml` configuration.

## Usage

- To stop all services:
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```
- To rebuild a specific service:
    ```
    docker-compose build <service_name>
    docker-compose up <service_name>
    ```

## Services

- Each service has its own directory with a `Dockerfile` and configuration files.
- Environment variables and service-specific settings can be adjusted in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Customization

- Add or remove services by editing the `docker-compose.yml`.
- Update environment variables for database connections, ports, and API keys as needed.
- For development, you can mount local source code into containers using Docker volumes.
